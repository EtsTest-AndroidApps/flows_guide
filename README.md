# Flows  Application

This is android application where I'll try to impliment the latest and the greatest along with links to the medium article. 
The project uses [DogApi](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/) for retrofit requests. It does not request any registration so you can build the application directly.

  - Uses coroutines
  - Flows on top of that
  - Channesl for downstream communication
  - MVVM architecture
  - Room, Retrofit, OkHTTP, Jetpack Componenets
